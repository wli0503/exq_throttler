# ExqThrottler

A throttler implementation for Exq.
* WORK IN PROGRESS. * 

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add exq_throttler to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:exq_throttler, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

## Usage

  1. Add `Exq.Middleware.Throttler` to your `config/*.exs`:
  ```
  # in config/dev.exs
  config :exq,
  # Note here that Exq.Middleware.Job must exist before Exq.Middleware.Throttler since
  # Throttler requires information from Job
  middleware: [Exq.Middleware.Job, Exq.Middleware.Throttler, <other middlewares>]
  ```

  2. Add configurations for `Exq.Middlware.Throttler` in `config/*.exs`:
  ```
  # in config/dev.exs
  config :exq,
    throttler: [
      <queue_name>: [
        period: 60,        
        threshold: 3,    
        delay: 60
      ]
    ]
  ```
  `period` and `threshold` in combine determines when it should throttle. Throttler will check the number of jobs in the period, then delay others according to the `delay` set in the configuration. Note that it's recommended to have `delay` >= `period`.
